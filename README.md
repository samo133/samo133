## 🔭 About Me
<p>
I’m training as a backend engineer through the <strong>ALX ProDev Backend</strong> program. I started software engineering because <strong>[insert why you started]</strong>. I'm passionate about building reliable, scalable backends and integrating AI to create smarter products. My goal is to ship deployable, production-quality systems and eventually launch my product or pursue a PhD in deployable AI systems.
</p>

## 🧭 Core Focus
- Backend architecture & scalable systems (monolith → microservices)  
- Data modeling, performance & observability (Postgres, caching, metrics)  
- Deployable AI features (model integration, inference pipelines, MLOps fundamentals)  
- Clean, testable code and automated delivery (CI/CD, containers)

---

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
<div>
  <strong>Languages:</strong> Python, SQL<br/>
  <strong>Frameworks:</strong> Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI<br/>
  <strong>Data & Storage:</strong> PostgreSQL, Redis<br/>
  <strong>Infra & DevOps:</strong> Docker, GitHub Actions, basic AWS/GCP concepts<br/>
  <strong>Async & Queues:</strong> Celery, RabbitMQ (or alternatives)<br/>
  <strong>AI / ML:</strong> Model integration, API-based LLMs, data pipelines (conceptual & applied)

## 📁 Featured Projects
> A short spotlight for recruiters / collaborators. Link to repositories and add 1–2 line descriptions.

- **AirBnB Clone Backend** — `Django + DRF` backend for property listings, bookings, payments; includes Celery, Redis, and Docker.  
  _Repo:_ `github.com/yourusername/airbnb-clone-backend`  
- **Project B** — short one-liner about what it demonstrates (e.g., async pipelines / performance tuning).  
  _Repo:_ `github.com/yourusername/project-b`  

> Tip: Use the pinned repositories feature on your profile to showcase these.

## 🚀 Current Learning & Roadmap
- **Now:** ALX ProDev Backend — implementing backend modules (auth, bookings, payments)  
- **Next (1–3 months):** Move from monolith → split services (User, Property, Booking), add caching & observability  
- **6-month goal:** Deploy mini-SaaS product, integrate a simple AI feature (smart recommendations or search assistant)  
- **Long term:** Build product or pursue PhD in deployable AI systems

---

## 🧩 How I Work / What I Bring
- Strong analytical & systems thinking — I decompose complex features into clear modules.  
- Learning style: auditory & structured — I learn best via clear walkthroughs, recorded explanations, and weekly milestone recaps.  
- I value clear docs, tests, and reproducible deployments.

---

## 📚 Learning & Resources (examples)
- FastAPI / DRF docs — essential for APIs  
- Use-the-Index-Luke — SQL & indexing  
- System Design Primer — architecture patterns  
*(Add links to notes, blog posts, or notebooks in your repos or Notion)*

---

## 🧾 Contribution & Collaboration
- I’m open to code reviews, pairing sessions, and mentorship in backend/ML ops.  
- If you want to collaborate: open an issue on the repo or drop a short DM (contact below).

## ⚡ Quick Wins to Make Profile Stand Out
1. Pin the 3 best repos (AirBnB Clone, one infra project, one AI-integration project).  
2. Add well-written README’s to each repo with a demo GIF and architecture diagram.  
3. Include a short video (1–2 min) in the project README where you walk through the project — plays to your auditory strength.  
4. Keep weekly commits and use GitHub Actions to run tests (showing activity + maturity).

### ✅ Next step — personalization
I can make this README uniquely yours (voice, tone, exact wording, links, project thumbnails, GIFs, video intros).  

**Quick list of things I need from you to personalize it right away:**
1. Exact display name and preferred short bio line.  
2. A 1–2 sentence personal motivation to replace `[insert why you started]`.  
3. Links to 2–4 repos you want highlighted (or confirm placeholders).  
4. Preferred contact email and any other socials you want shown.  
5. If you have a short intro video or demo GIF (or want me to draft a script for the video).

Would you like me to:  
- (A) personalize the README now using your answers, **or**  
- (B) generate ready-to-paste README + repo README templates (for each highlighted project) and a short video script for the 1–2 minute walkthrough?

---

**My quick opinion:** This template will position you strongly — it emphasizes architecture thinking, learning trajectory, and product intent (which recruiters and hiring managers appreciate). The auditory-angle suggestion (video walkthroughs / voice recaps) is a high-leverage differentiator for you.

What do you want me to do next to make this README truly yours?
