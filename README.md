## 🔭 About Me
<p>
I’m training as a backend engineer through the ALX ProDev Backend program. I started software engineering because I’m passionate about merging artificial intelligence with software engineering to create smarter, more adaptive, and user-centered products. I’m driven by the idea of transforming complex systems into intelligent, deployable solutions that learn and evolve. My goal is to ship production-quality systems that combine scalability with intelligence — and eventually, to either launch my own AI-driven product on deployable AI systems.
</p>

## 🧭 Core Focus
- Backend architecture & scalable systems (monolith → microservices)  
- Data modeling, performance & observability (Postgres, caching, metrics)  
- Deployable AI features (model integration, inference pipelines, MLOps fundamentals)  
- Clean, testable code and automated delivery (CI/CD, containers)

---

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
<div>
  <strong>Languages:</strong> Python, SQL<br/>
  <strong>Frameworks:</strong> Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI<br/>
  <strong>Data & Storage:</strong> PostgreSQL, Redis<br/>
  <strong>Infra & DevOps:</strong> Docker, GitHub Actions, basic AWS/GCP concepts<br/>
  <strong>Async & Queues:</strong> Celery, RabbitMQ (or alternatives)<br/>
  <strong>AI / ML:</strong> Model integration, API-based LLMs, data pipelines (conceptual & applied)

## 📁 Featured Projects
> A short spotlight for recruiters / collaborators. Link to repositories and add 1–2 line descriptions.

- **AirBnB Clone Backend** — `Django + DRF` backend for property listings, bookings, payments; includes Celery, Redis, and Docker.  
  _Repo:_ `github.com/yourusername/airbnb-clone-backend`  
 

---

## 🚀 Current Learning & Roadmap
- **Now:** ALX ProDev Backend — implementing backend modules (auth, bookings, payments)  
- **Next (1–3 months):** Move from monolith → split services (User, Property, Booking), add caching & observability  
- **6-month goal:** Deploy mini-SaaS product, integrate a simple AI feature (smart recommendations or search assistant)  
- **Long term:** Build product or pursue PhD in deployable AI systems

---

## 🧩 How I Work / What I Bring
- Strong analytical & systems thinking — I decompose complex features into clear modules.  
- Learning style: auditory & structured — I learn best via clear walkthroughs, recorded explanations, and weekly milestone recaps.  
- I value clear docs, tests, and reproducible deployments.

---

## 📚 Learning & Resources (examples)
- FastAPI / DRF docs — essential for APIs  
- Use-the-Index-Luke — SQL & indexing  
- System Design Primer — architecture patterns  

---

## 🧾 Contribution & Collaboration
- I’m open to code reviews, pairing sessions, and mentorship in backend/ML ops.  
- If you want to collaborate: open an issue on the repo or drop a short DM (contact below).
